0.18.0
======

Features:
---------

* Add fuzzy matching for the table names and column names. 

  Matching very long table/column names are now easier with fuzzy matching. The
  fuzzy match works like the fuzzy open in SublimeText or Vim's Ctrl-P plugin. 

  eg: Typing ``djmv`` will match `django_migration_views` since it is able to
  match parts of the input to the full table name.

* Change the timing information to seconds. 
  
  The ``Command Time`` and ``Format Time`` are now displayed in seconds instead
  of a unitless number displayed in scientific notation.

* Support for named queries (favorite queries). (Thanks: `Brett`_)

  Frequently typed queries can now be saved and recalled using a name using
  newly added special commands (``\n[+]``, ``\ns``, ``\nd``).

  eg: 

::

    # Save a query
    pgcli> \ns simple select * from foo
    saved

    # List all saved queries
    pgcli> \n+

    # Execute a saved query
    pgcli> \n simple

    # Delete a saved query
    pgcli> \nd simple

* Pasting queries into the pgcli repl is orders of magnitude faster. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)


Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fix an error when running ``\d table_name`` when running on a table with rules. (Thanks: `Ali Kargın`_)
* Fix a pgcli crash when entering non-ascii characters in Windows. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_, `Jonathan Slenders`_)

Internal Changes:
-----------------

* Complete refactor of handling the back-slash commands. It is now easier to
  add new special back-slash commands using a decorator.

* Change the config file management to use ConfigObj.(Thanks: `Brett`_)

  Previously completions only matched a table name if it started with the
  partially typed word. Now completions will match even if the partially typed
  word is in the middle of a suggestion.
